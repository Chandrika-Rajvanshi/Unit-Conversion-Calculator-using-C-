# Unit-Conversion-Calculator-using-C-
While performing calculations, be it in the field of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics or any physical research work, the students may encounter tedious errors emerging due to incorrect usage of units hence, there is a need to accomplish an ample research to discover the intricacies involved in the entire process.

To tackle this issue, there is a need of a “Menu Driven Unit Conversion Calculator” so that all the conversions between the different physical quantities required for the extensive calculations in research work can be made easily on one screen.

This “Unit Conversion Calculator” has been designed within the boundaries of the concepts taught and learnt in the Software Development Fundamentals-II classes and serves as an easy to use tool to carry out conversions between different units and measurements.

It is a small program developed extensively to exercise what we could learn during the semester study. The project shall help identify and resolve common problems.

This menu-driven unit converting calculator eliminates the use of different devices to perform different calculations and rather, provides one single window where all kinds of conversions can be performed.
